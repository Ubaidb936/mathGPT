44 + 5,49.0,49,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 49, which matches the reference answer of 49.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The mathematical operation of addition was performed correctly, and the factual accuracy is maintained."
14 - 53,-39.0,-39,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is ""-39"" which matches the reference answer ""-39.0"" when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The subtraction has been performed correctly, showing an understanding of basic arithmetic operations involving negative results."
4 / 66,0.06,0.06060606060606061,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided, 0.06060606060606061, is a more precise representation of the division 4 / 66, which equals approximately 0.06060606 when calculated with more decimal places. The reference answer given is 0.06, which is a rounded version of the precise calculation. Although the response shows a deeper level of precision, it aligns with the mathematical result of the division. Therefore, the response can be considered correct as it is accurate and factual, even exceeding the precision of the reference answer."
82 + 36,118.0,118,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 118, which matches the reference answer of 118.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The calculation is accurate as the sum of 82 and 36 indeed equals 118. Therefore, the response is factually correct and aligns with the mathematical operation of addition as requested."
68 - 35,33.0,33,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 33, which matches the reference answer of 33.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The subtraction operation was performed correctly, and the result is accurate."
8 + 76,84.0,84,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 84, which matches the reference answer of 84.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The mathematical operation of addition was performed correctly, and the factual accuracy is maintained as both answers represent the same numerical value."
35 / 34,1.03,1.0294117647058822,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 1.0294117647058822, which is the precise result of dividing 35 by 34. The reference answer is rounded to 1.03. The response shows a detailed and accurate calculation, matching the exact division result. However, since the reference answer is rounded to two decimal places, the response could be considered slightly more precise than required but still aligns closely with the reference answer."
96 - 13,83.0,83,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 83, which matches the reference answer of 83.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The subtraction has been performed correctly, and the answer is accurate and factual."
81 * 36,2916.0,2916,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 2916, which matches the reference answer of 2916.0 when considering integer multiplication. The calculation is accurate as multiplying 81 by 36 indeed results in 2916. Therefore, the response is factually correct and adheres to the mathematical operation specified in the task."
83 + 90,173.0,173,Correct,"Feedback: The response provided is 173, which matches the reference answer of 173.0 when considering integer and decimal equivalence. The calculation is accurate as adding 83 and 90 indeed results in 173. Therefore, the response is factually correct and aligns with the mathematical operation of addition as required by the problem."
